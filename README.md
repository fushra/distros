## Motivations

The goal of this project is to simplify the process of a new user choosing to install linux. At the moment, you have to go research through articles, which include some distros that you may just not want, wasting time and energy. Short of reducing the number of distros there are out there, which would hurt the community, we need to make this process easier. Hence, this project exists.

## Future features

- [ ] More distros
- [ ] More questions (Please do suggest some in [the discussions tab](https://github.com/fushra/distros/discussions)!)
- [ ] Application recommendations based on what they have said they are using their computer for
