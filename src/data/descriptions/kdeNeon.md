## Solid Core, Latest Features

More than ever people expect a stable desktop with cutting-edge features, all in a package which is easy to use and ready to make their own.

When you want your computer as your tool, something that belongs to you, that you can trust and that delivers day after day, week after week, year after year. Here it is: now get stuff done.
