Pop!\_OS is an operating system for STEM and creative professionals who use their computer as a tool to discover and create. Unleash your potential on secure, reliable open source software. Based on your exceptional curiosity, we sense you have a lot of it.

## Streamline your workflow

Pop!\_OS is designed for fast navigation, easy workspace organization, and fluid, convenient workflow. Your operating system should encourage discovery, not obstruct it.

### Workflow Customization

While you’ve got your wheels turning, take the scenic route with a dock and touchpad gestures, or race along a minimalist track from behind the wheel of a revving keyboard. With a variety of both mouse-driven and keyboard-driven customizations, you’re empowered to navigate your workflow the way you’ve always wanted.

### Auto-Tiling With Pop Shell

Pop!\_OS uses auto-tiling for the same reason that people hire assistants: Organizing your work is incredibly time-consuming. Sure, you could still move, resize, and arrange windows yourself, but why spend the time when your OS does it for you? Auto-tiling helps you be both organized and efficient, and is especially convenient on large displays.

### Workspaces

Keep relevant content together and irrelevant content out of sight. When the clutter overwhelms you, just toss it onto another desktop. Problem solved.

### Keyboard Navigation

Arm yourself with a dark-lord level of power at your fingertips. Use keyboard shortcuts to:

- move/resize windows
- search for anything
- launch applications

### Stacking

Stack application windows atop one another like tabs in a web browser. Just remember to switch off of Steam when the boss walks in.

## Development toolkits work flawlessly

Develop software out of the box with a vast array of libraries and tools at your disposal. Pop!\_OS uses APT and Flatpak package management, meaning it’s easy to install, remove, and update all software on the OS.

## GET EVERY ADVANTAGE ON SYSTEM76 HARDWARE

### Form of: An amazing computer.

System76 hardware is engineered together with Pop!\_OS for optimal performance and user experience. Our computers empower creators, makers, and builders to go forth and discover.

Launch keyboard and Pop!\_OS propel your ideas forward at max velocity. Customize your layout, pluck and place keycaps, turn down Caps Lock, and take your changes with you wherever you go.

## Keep your computer secure

### Encryption out of the box

Pop!\_OS encrypts your installation by default, and is the only Linux distribution that enables pre-installed full-disk encryption out of the box. A unique private encryption key is generated during setup after you receive your computer.

### Update on Your Terms

Pop!\_OS provides the latest features and security patches through rolling updates and periodic OS version upgrades, to be performed at your discretion. And if you want a clean slate, the Refresh Install feature resets your OS while preserving the files in your Home folder.

### Privacy

Pop!\_OS does not collect or store any info from user installations. Minimal OS and hardware data is used—not stored—to provide updates and connectivity verification. Apps packaged through Flatpak require permission to access more than what’s needed to function.

### Firmware Management

Automatic firmware updates can be accessed from your software settings on System76 hardware. These updates help to promptly quash any threat of security risk to your computer.

## Compatible with most software tools

That app you desperately need in order to function? We probably have it. The vast software libraries of Ubuntu and Flatpak combine to make all of your tools available in a single location, called the Pop!\_Shop. The Pop!\_Shop is our version of Android’s Play Store or the App Store on iOS, and we’re constantly adding new applications to the mix—a productivity cocktail that goes down smooth.
