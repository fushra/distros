The open source Ubuntu desktop operating system powers millions of PCs and laptops around the world.

## Complete

Ubuntu comes with everything you need to run your organisation, school, home or enterprise. All the essential applications, like an office suite, browsers, email and media apps come pre-installed and thousands more games and applications are available in the Ubuntu Software Centre.

## Open source

Ubuntu has always been free to download, use and share. We believe in the power of open source software; Ubuntu could not exist without its worldwide community of voluntary developers.

## Secure

With a built-in firewall and virus protection software, Ubuntu is one of the most secure operating systems around. And the long-term support releases give you five years of security patches and updates.

## Accessible

Computing is for everyone regardless of nationality, gender or disability. Ubuntu is fully translated into over 50 languages and includes essential assistive technologies.

## Visually stunning, wherever it’s used

Ubuntu gets the most from your screen, with high definition and touchscreen support. 20.04 has a new default theme, Yaru, as well as integrated light and dark themes, resulting in Ubuntu getting a fresh new look while maintaining its signature feel.

## Available on the largest range of hardware, ever

Canonical works closely with Dell, Lenovo and HP to certify that Ubuntu works on a wide range of their laptops and workstations. It means that a seamless Ubuntu experience is available out of the box with more hardware choice than ever.

And Ubuntu isn’t just for the desktop, it is used in data centres around the world powering every kind of server imaginable and is by far, the most popular operating system in the cloud.
